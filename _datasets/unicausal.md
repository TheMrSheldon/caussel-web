    Current causal text mining datasets vary in objectives, data coverage, and annotation schemes. These inconsistent efforts prevent modeling capabilities and fair comparisons of model performance. Furthermore, few datasets include cause-effect span annotations, which are needed for end-to-end causal relation extraction. To address these issues, we propose UniCausal, a unified benchmark for causal text mining across three tasks: (I) Causal Sequence Classification, (II) Cause-Effect Span Detection and (III) Causal Pair Classification. We consolidated and aligned annotations of six high quality, mainly human-annotated, corpora, resulting in a total of 58,720, 12,144 and 69,165 examples for each task respectively. Since the definition of causality can be subjective, our framework was designed to allow researchers to work on some or all datasets and tasks. To create an initial benchmark, we fine-tuned BERT pre-trained language models to each task, achieving 70.10% Binary F1, 52.42% Macro F1, and 84.68% Binary F1 scores respectively.
